<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



### Built With

* .NET


## Course Information

Software I - C# builds object-oriented programming expertise and introduces powerful new tools for C# application development. You will learn about and put into action: class design, exception handling, and other object-oriented principles and constructs to develop software that meets business requirements. This course requires foundational knowledge of object-oriented programming.

### Competencies

**Classes and Interfaces**

The graduate designs software solutions with appropriate classes, objects, methods, and interfaces to achieve specific goals.

**Object-Oriented Principles**

The graduate implements object-oriented design principles (e.g., inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction) in developing applications for ensuring the application's scalability.

**Application Development**

The graduate produces applications using high-level programming language constructs to meet business requirements.

**Exception Handling**
The graduate incorporates simple exception handling in application development for improving user experience and application stability.

**User Interface Development**
The graduate develops user interfaces to meet project requirements.

### Scenario

You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. They have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program.

They have provided you with a mock-up of the user interface to use in the design and development of the system (see the attached "GUI Mock-Up") and a class diagram to assist you in your work (see the attached "UML Class Diagram"). The organization also has specific business requirements that must be included as part of the application. A system analyst from your company created the solution statements outlined in the requirements section based on the manufacturing organization's business requirements. You will use these solution statements to develop your application.
